Vector combat orianna-meets-ness
Throw a ball
- can teleport to the ball
- ball does dmg

lego star wars yoda who is super immobile outside of combat
platformer where, if you kill the enemies without using them for mobility you cant finish the level
essentially all movment abilities are context-sensitive combat abilities

juggling enemies as the CORE movement AND combat ability
- both pulls you towards an enemy AND THEN knocks them away from you
- attacking starts a combo meter where you can double jump and stuff?
- click and hold to charge attack?
- striking the enemy builds charges, used for double jumps or extra attacks
- what is your range? can you dash to any enemy on screen?
- hits become stronger as you juggle (combo increases)
- always two vectors involved: you to enemy, and enemy to cursor
	- how to target enemy then?
- not a frantic runner like GD, a more controlled rhythm of technical mechanics strung together
- or is it instead always one vector, you to enemy
	- if so, you need a way to reposition your angle to the enemy
- you can probably climb straight up on an enemy

imagine you're dashing quickly through a horizontal level juggling progressively more enemies, 3, 4, 5+...

ok wait what about actually being hit by the enemy...
are they melee? mario? ranged?
- dodging ranged projectiles via attack-dashes
- dodging attack animations via attack-dashes

- enemies can have different masses (e.g. requiring higher combos to juggle higher)

- you should be able to hover in the air with double jumps and juggle

is it a dash or a teleport?


LEVEL IDEAS
X Tutorial: climb a cliff by juggling a single enemy
- Cross a long horizontal gap via double-jump-hovering and juggling a tanky enemy all the way across
- Very crowded level where you need to juggle to stay above the crowd?
- Vertical level with flying enemies in a triangle wave pattern
- Knock an enemy into a timed button which opens a gate
- Jump over a gap into a vertical wall, must blink through the wall to a pacing enemy (timing)
- U shape, melee enemy, spikes at bottom (and sides)

action-puzzle-platformer

MVP:
- Floor
- Enemy
- You can dash to the enemy and knock them back
- Maybe add in a jump
- (should be tomorrow morning wtihin a few hours)

enemy health
- tanky = get lots of height
- one hit = free momentum

probably needs to be a cooldown on attacks (quick but not instant)
killing an enemy preserves dash momentum

saturday = mechanics, art, sound
sunday = level design, menu

buttons where you have to launch an enemy or launch yourself to activate

enemies which pace back and forth, cannot be dashed to from the FRONT

weapons:
- stick (low/no damage, can juggle indefinitely)
- sword (normal dmg)

walljump? (and cieling jump?) (does not reset double jump)

arrow keys to affect momentum after dash? (or relative position?)

when coming down onto enemies, bounce off?
- or always bounce upwards, regardless of direction (not as fast as enemies are propelled of course)
- enemies always pop up also?? (feels like the wrong approach/ makes it too easy?)

maybe dash should be a blink
- blink through walls
- 

enemies should be sufficiently dangerous
- requires a balance of just killing enemies to be safer v. using enemies for mobility

Enemy types
- tanky passive cow
- aggressive dashing enemy (charge on sight)
- front-armored pacing enemy (can't dash from front)
- flying 1hp
- projectile shooting enemies
- spikes
- homing meteor heads?
- invuln enemies you just have to dodge?

what is this game called?
- 'Vector Combat (unfinished)', 'Gem Drop', 'State of Nature (v1, unfinished)', '????'
- "Double Tap"
- Something yin yang 
- "Duel Purpose"
- "Duel Porpoise", and make the game aquatic sealife-themed
	- Stab things with your horn
- Asian/ninja themed words: mantra, zen
- "Duel Effect"
- dash, duel, ninja, super, 
- Dashdance


Juice
- Make soundtrack swell with combo magnitude 
- Slomo on last kill
- Gratuitous blood
- Super innovative red-black-white color scheme (never before seen)
- Screenshake

Mario-shaped levels basically


gfx
- dash indicator (?)
- health indicator (?)
X blood particles
X enemy sprites
X spike sprites
X wall sprites (?)
- death fx
X screen shake
- walking sprite
- bounciness

also TODO
- 10+ levels
X tutorial text
X pacing enemies
X level transitions
- level menu
- jumping enemies?


X sound fx???
- name
- upload

Priority:
X background
- fix walljump bug!?!?
- levels
X eyeball enemy
X ending door
- other directional spikes

extra:
- more sfx, variety
- more particle fx
- more sprites
- health/dash ui
- walking sprite (player)
- walking sprite (enemy)
- damage sprite (enemy)
- death fx

bugs 
- glitching into blocks when dashing (make player slightly taller?)
- hitting multiple enemies?
- running into enemies on dash (invuln frames?)
- coming down at enemies = basically instakill (see above?)
- dashing and getting magnet-stuck under platforms (cancel dash on collision)
- disable arrow keys after dash
- up triggers cancel minotaur movement
- walking can exceed walking speed (only allow > walk speed in air)
